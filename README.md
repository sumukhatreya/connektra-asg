This project implements simple trigger-action workflows. When a trigger node (an integrated thrid-party service) initiates an event, the server processes the event and executes the configured action.

To run the code, first download the repository using the `git clone` command. Then install client and server dependencies using `npm install`. Finally run the client server on port `5173`, and the server on port `3000` on localhost.
